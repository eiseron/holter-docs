# New Monitor

The New Monitor form lets you configure a URL to be checked on a recurring schedule.

## Accessing the Form

Click **New Monitor** on the Monitors page, or navigate directly to `/monitoring/workspaces/{workspace_slug}/monitor/new`.

If your workspace is at quota, the button is disabled. Delete or archive an existing monitor first.

## Technical Settings

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| URL | The full HTTP or HTTPS address to check. Must start with `http://` or `https://`. |
| Method | HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD. |
| Timeout | Maximum seconds to wait for a response before marking the check as failed. |
| Follow Redirects | When enabled, the checker follows HTTP redirects. Disable to assert an exact status code at the given URL. |
| Max Redirects | Maximum number of redirects to follow (only visible when Follow Redirects is on). |
| Request Body | Request payload sent with the request (only visible for POST, PUT, PATCH). |
| Headers | Custom HTTP headers as a JSON object, e.g. `{"Authorization": "Bearer token"}`. |
| Positive Keywords | Words separated by commas or semicolons that must appear in the response body. A missing keyword marks the check as failed. |
| Negative Keywords | Words separated by commas or semicolons that must **not** appear in the response body. A found keyword marks the check as failed. |

## Security Settings

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Ignore SSL Errors | When enabled, SSL certificate issues (expired, invalid, self-signed) do not cause check failures. Useful for internal services with self-signed certs. |

## Interval Settings

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Check Interval | How often the monitor runs, in seconds. The minimum allowed interval is set by your workspace plan. |
| State | Initial state: **Active** (checks run immediately) or **Paused** (monitoring suspended). |

## Validation

The form validates in real time as you type. Errors appear inline below each field. The **Create Monitor** button is disabled until all required fields are valid.

## After Creation

On success, you are redirected to the Monitor Settings page for the new monitor. The monitor begins checking on the next dispatch cycle (within one minute for active monitors).

To link notification channels to the monitor, go to **Channels** in the left sidebar, open a channel, and select the monitor from the Linked Monitors list. See [Notification Channels](../delivery/notification-channels.md).
